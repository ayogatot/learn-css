                Glaurung The Father of Dragons
            </h1>
            <p>
                Glaurung was contained in Angband for another two centuries before he was again loosed during the
                Fourth Battle of the Battles of Beleriand. Known as the Dagor Bragollach for the fires unleashed by
                Morgoth from the Iron Mountains, Glaurung in full power led Melkor's forces against the High Elves
                of Beleriand.

            <p>
                Ancalagon, also known as Ancalagon the Black, was the greatest of all winged dragons. He was bred by
                Morgoth during the First Age, and was the largest dragon to have ever existed in Middle-earth. His
                appearance in history was restricted to the War of Wrath.
